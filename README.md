Ostromia is an experiment in **token-driven localism**:  
- **Essay:** a manifesto on commons-centric governance for AI-disrupted cities.  
- **cadCAD Model:** 7-day minimal simulation of City-Point minting via a bonding curve.  
- **Bonding-Curve Library:** reusable math for continuous civic-token issuance.

## âœ¨ Project Highlights
- **Commons as infrastructure** â€” programmable, adaptive, regenerative.  
- **City Points** â€” participatory currency that turns care into capital.  
- **Token engineering** â€” bonding curves + cadCAD stress tests.
